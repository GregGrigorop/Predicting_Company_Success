# Predicting_Company_Success

In the context of this **End-to-End Machine Learning project** I built a Machine Learning model to predict the success of a startup. We could think of various 
ways to achieve this, but what I came up with is to predict the total funding amount a company will raise in specific funding rounds
and define its success based on that. We can then also assess whether a company/startup will raise a specific funding round type or not,
e.g. a Series A or Series B, so as to potentially assess if it is worth investing in a startup for example. For this project I utilised
data from the Crunchbase 2013 dataset (the data is not included here).

<ins>Main stages of the project</ins>

1. Loading the data
2. Initial Wrangling/Cleaning
3. Feature Selection & Addition of new features
4. Exploring/Visualising data
5. Mathematical/Modelling approach description
6. Preparing the data for Machine Learning algorithms
7. Training various models and shortlisting the most promising ones
8. Hyperparameter Search

- `numpy` module. [(pypi link](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) [/ numpy link)](https://numpy.org/)
- `scikit-learn` package. [(pypi link](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/) [/ sklearn link)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- `pandas` library. [(pypi link](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) [/ pandas link)](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

Note: This is an *end-to-end Machine Learning project* with a lot of cleaning/wrangling/EDA, data preparation for ML algorithms and
predictions. It is my first "out-in-the-wild" personal Machine Learning project and I learned many things while working on it, it was enjoyable and constructive!
